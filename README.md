# Fraud-Analysis
This is a brief analysis and predictive model comparison over the fraud data set found on Kaggle.

The data was too large for Git so feel free to download it from:

https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud#creditcard.csv

And place it in a folder called "data" in the same directory as the notebook to run it.

Its run on python 3.5 and the latest versions of sklearn, light gbm, and tensorflow and keras for that python version.
